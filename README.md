This repository is a snapshot of work-in-progress to modernize IDLE's
user interface. These changes are slowly making their way into the
official repository...

To try it out, download, either as a zip file or by cloning the git 
repository. Place everything inside a directory called "idlelib"
(this is important!). Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory
*containing* "idlelib", and run:

    python3 -m idlelib

As I've been working on this, I've been documenting the changes 
at <http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/idle.html>.
